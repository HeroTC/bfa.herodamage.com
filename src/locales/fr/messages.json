However, you should <0>simulate your own character</0> to find your best setup. These simulations are based on predefined gear sets instead of your own, after all. This means data shown here <1>depends heavily</1> on the used profile with its talents, legendaries etc. and is rather giving an outlook. If your character is different from the setup used here, personal simulations are recommended.": "",
