  "If you are interested in how the different races in World of Warcraft compare for this build, you can check out the following chart. However, keep in mind that race differences are usually rather small and can change with balance and gameplay changes. You can always play the race you want to play and don&apos,t have to feel compelled to choose based on this chart.": "",
  "In order to compare azerite powers with this chart, look for the end of the bars corresponding to the item level of interest. However, you should <0>simulate your own character</0> to find your best setup. These simulations are based on predefined gear sets instead of your own, after all. This means data shown here <1>depends heavily</1> on the used profile with its talents, its gear, etc. and is rather giving an outlook. If your character is different from the setup used here, personal simulations are recommended.": "",
